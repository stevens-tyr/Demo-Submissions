# Tyr Demo Assignment Submissions

This is a repository that holds previous assignments from classes we have taken at Stevens.

The homework assignments serve to show how our application holds up in the "real-world".

## How to Use

The assignments are currently in a "wrong" state, meaning that there is some kind of mistake that you can identify by the TODO comment directly above it.
